  Plugins

jsTree comes with a few plugin bundled, but they will only modify your tree if you activate them using the "plugins" config option. Here is a brief description of each plugin. You can read more on the available config options for each plugin in the API docs.

checkbox

Renders a checkbox icon in front of each node, making multiselection easy. It also has a "tri-state" option, meaning a node with some of its children checked will get a "square" icon.

Keep in mind that if any sort of cascade is enabled, disabled nodes may be checked too (not by themselves, but for example when a parent of a disabled node is checked and selection is configured to cascade down).

$("#tree").jstree({
  "plugins" : ["checkbox"]
});

contextmenu

Makes it possible to right click nodes and shows a list of configurable actions in a menu.

$("#tree").jstree({
  "core" : { "check_callback" : true }, // so that modifying operations work
  "plugins" : ["contextmenu"]
});
view result

dnd

Makes it possible to drag and drop tree nodes and rearrange the tree.

$("#tree").jstree({
  "core" : { "check_callback" : true }, // so that operations work
  "plugins" : ["dnd"]
});

massload

Makes it possible to load multiple nodes in a single go (for a lazy loaded tree).

$("#tree").jstree({
  "core" : {
    "data" : { .. AJAX config .. }
  },
  "massload" : {
    "url" : "/some/path",
    "data" : function (nodes) {
      return { "ids" : nodes.join(",") };
    }
  },
  "plugins" : [ "massload", "state" ]
});
search

Adds the possibility to search for items in the tree and show only matching nodes. It also has AJAX / callback hooks, so that search will work on lazy loaded trees too.

<form id="s">
  <input type="search" id="q" />
  <button type="submit">Search</button>
</form>
<script>
$("#container").jstree({
  "plugins" : ["search"]
});
$("#s").submit(function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  $("#container").jstree(true).search($("#q").val());
});
</script>

sort

Automatically arranges all sibling nodes according to a comparison config option function, which defaults to alphabetical order.

$("#tree").jstree({
  "plugins" : ["sort"]
});
view result

state

Saves all opened and selected nodes in the user's browser, so when returning to the same tree the previous state will be restored.

$("#tree").jstree({
  // the key is important if you have multiple trees in the same domain
  "state" : { "key" : "state_demo" },
  "plugins" : ["state"]
});
view result

types

Makes it possible to add a "type" for a node, which means to easily control nesting rules and icon for groups of nodes instead of individually. To set a node type add a type property to the node structure.

$("#tree").jstree({
  "types" : {
    "default" : {
      "icon" : "glyphicon glyphicon-flash"
    },
    "demo" : {
      "icon" : "glyphicon glyphicon-ok"
    }
  },
  "plugins" : ["types"]
});
view result

unique

Enforces that no nodes with the same name can coexist as siblings - prevents renaming and moving nodes to a parent, which already contains a node with the same name.

$("#tree").jstree({
  "plugins" : ["unique"]
});
view result

wholerow

Makes each node appear block level which makes selection easier. May cause slow down for large trees in old browsers.

$("#tree").jstree({
  "plugins" : ["wholerow"]
});
view result

More plugins

If you create your own plugin (or download a 3rd party one) you must include its source on the page and list its name in the "plugins" config array.

// conditional select
(function ($, undefined) {
  "use strict";
  $.jstree.defaults.conditionalselect = function () { return true; };
  $.jstree.plugins.conditionalselect = function (options, parent) {
    this.activate_node = function (obj, e) {
      if(this.settings.conditionalselect.call(this, this.get_node(obj))) {
        parent.activate_node.call(this, obj, e);
      }
    };
  };
})(jQuery);
$("#tree").jstree({
  "conditionalselect" : function (node) {
    return node.text === "Root node" ? false : true;
  },
  "plugins" : ["conditionalselect"]
});
view result

As seen here when creating a plugin you can define a default config, add your own functions to jstree, or override existing ones while maintaining the ability to call the overridden function.
